*PeopleSoft*

Background
------------

With Gideon Taylor, I was assigned to create a database and UI within PeopleSoft Application Designer for users to check in and check out different equipment. They had a record of the amount of items taken out and when returned, they recieved a report on how good of care the individual took care of that specific item.
